# 💻 Hangcode

This project is a creative spin on the classic Hangman game, where instead of building a stick figure, you progressively eliminate **programming languages** with each incorrect guess. The goal remains the same: guess the hidden word one letter at a time before your chances run out — but in this version, you're racing to save your favorite coding tools from extinction!

With this game, you can:

✅ Guess hidden words letter by letter  
✅ See eliminated programming languages as incorrect guesses  
✅ Play with a clean, responsive UI built for all screen sizes  
✅ Replay with randomly selected words for a fresh challenge each time
